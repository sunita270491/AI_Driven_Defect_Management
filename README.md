# AI-Driven Defect Management System

## Overview
This project aims to leverage AI to enhance defect management by analyzing defect reports, identifying required updates, and providing AI-generated suggestions. The system integrates with various defect management tools and notifies developers when updates are needed.

## Features

### Must-Have (M)
- AI-driven analysis of defect reports to assess whether updates are needed.
- Automatic identification of defect fields that require updates (e.g., Description, Steps to Reproduce, Expected Result).
- Integration with defect management tools (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps, Bugzilla, GitHub Issues).
- Notifications to developers when updates are required.
- AI-generated suggestions for updating defect descriptions based on existing patterns and historical data.
- Web extension or software interface to interact with developers.
- User authentication and role-based access.

### Should-Have (S)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance defect descriptions.
- Historical analysis to predict defect resolution time based on past records.
- API-based integration with additional project management tools.

### Could-Have (C)
- Voice assistant interaction for defect updates.
- Dashboard analytics showing trends in defect resolution and updates.

### Wonâ€™t-Have (W)
- Direct AI resolution of defects (only recommendations and content updates, not bug fixes).
- Automated decision-making without developer approval.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Setup and Configuration
1. Select a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) for hosting AI models and backend services.
2. Set up a database (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for storing defect records, AI suggestions, and feedback.
3. Configure OAuth/API keys for integration with Jira, Azure DevOps, Bugzilla, etc.

### Step 2: Develop the AI Engine
1. Train an NLP model using past defect data to detect missing or outdated fields.
2. Implement a classification algorithm to determine when a defect needs an update.
3. Deploy AI as a microservice (e.g., Flask/FastAPI) with REST APIs.

### Step 3: Build Integration Layer
1. Implement API connectors for defect management systems.
2. Develop a scheduler to periodically fetch defect data and trigger AI analysis.

### Step 4: Notification System
1. Implement email and chatbot notifications (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).
2. Create a messaging queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or AWS SQS) for asynchronous processing.

### Step 5: Develop User Interface
1. Build a browser extension for real-time defect updates.
2. Develop a web dashboard for reviewing AI suggestions.
3. Implement authentication and role-based access control.

### Step 6: Deploy and Monitor
1. Deploy services using Docker/Kubernetes.
2. Set up monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) to track AI performance and system health.
3. Implement logging (ELK stack or CloudWatch) for debugging.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Node.js (for the browser extension)
- Access to cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Access to defect management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps, Bugzilla, GitHub Issues)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defect-management-ai.git
   cd defect-management-ai
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```sh
   # Example for PostgreSQL
   createdb defect_management
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update the .env file with your configuration
   ```

5. Run the AI microservice:
   ```sh
   cd ai_service
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. Run the integration layer:
   ```sh
   cd integration_layer
   python scheduler.py
   ```

7. Run the notification system:
   ```sh
   cd notification_system
   python notifier.py
   ```

8. Run the user interface:
   ```sh
   cd ui
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### Deployment

1. Build and run Docker containers:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. Deploy to Kubernetes:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s
   ```

3. Set up monitoring and logging:
   ```sh
   # Example for Prometheus and Grafana
   kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus
   kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana
   ```
